Hi, it's great to see you ~ 👋

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Technology at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) under the Senior Engineer [Zonghui Wang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/zhwang) and Professor [Wenzhi Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0092215) since 2024 🤗. Prior to that, I received my B.Sc. degree in Information and Computing Science from [Liaoning Technical University](https://en.lntu.edu.cn/).

**Current Research**: My research focuses on `generative AI`, particularly (multimodal) large language models 🤖. I am specifically exploring content safety, knowledge-based Q&A, prompt learning, and fine-tuning✨. Additionally, I have a keen interest in the intersection of AI with the arts and other humanities disciplines 😊.

**Undergraduate Research**: During my undergraduate years, I had the privilege of engaging in mathematical modeling and was awarded second prize🥈 in the [China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling](https://en.mcm.edu.cn/) in my sophomore year 🎉. It was during this time that I discovered my interest in `evolutionary computation` ✨. Alongside my undergraduate team, I contributed to the development of [PID-based search algorithm (PSA)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095741742301388X), [love evolution algorithm (LEA)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-024-05905-4), and more 🚀. While I'm currently focused on generative AI, I'm still interested in evolutionary computation 🔧.

**Feel free to contact me if you are curious about my research or to discuss potential collaborations, including but not limited to generative AI and evolutionary computation!** 😄 You can contact me via Email(y.gao@zju.edu.cn) or WeChat (fyvknh).
