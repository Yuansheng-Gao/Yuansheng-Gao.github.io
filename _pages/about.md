Hi, it's great to see you ~ ðŸ‘‹

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Technology at [Zhejiang University](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/) under the Senior Engineer [Zonghui Wang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/zhwang) and Professor [Wenzhi Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0092215) since 2024 ðŸ¤—. Prior to that, I received my B.Sc. degree in Information and Computing Science from [Liaoning Technical University](https://en.lntu.edu.cn/).

**Current Research**: My research focuses on [generative artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence), particularly (multimodal) large language models ðŸ¤–. I am specifically exploring content safety, knowledge-based Q&A, prompt learning, and fine-tuningâœ¨. Additionally, I have a keen interest in the intersection of AI with the arts and other humanities disciplines ðŸ˜Š.

**Undergraduate Research**: During my undergraduate years, I had the privilege of engaging in mathematical modeling and was awarded second prizeðŸ¥ˆ in the China University Student Mathematical Modeling Competition in my sophomore year ðŸŽ‰. It was during this time that I discovered my interest in metaheuristics âœ¨. Alongside my undergraduate team, I contributed to the development of [PID-based search algorithm (PSA)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095741742301388X), [love evolution algorithm (LEA)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-024-05905-4), and more ðŸš€ðŸ”§.

**Feel free to reach out if you're interested in my research, including but not limited to generative artificial intelligence and metaheuristics!** ðŸ˜„ You can contact me via Email(y.gao@zju.edu.cn) or WeChat (fyvknh).
