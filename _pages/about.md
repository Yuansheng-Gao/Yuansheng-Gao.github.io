Hi, it's great to see you ~ ðŸ‘‹

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Technology at [Zhejiang University](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/) under the Senior Engineer [Zonghui Wang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/zhwang) and Professor [Wenzhi Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0092215) since 2024. Prior to that, I received my B.Sc. degree in Information and Computing Science from [Liaoning Technical University](https://en.lntu.edu.cn/).

`Research`: My research focuses on generative artificial intelligence, particularly (multimodal) large language models. I am specifically exploring content safety, knowledge-based question answering, prompt learning, and fine-tuning methods. Additionally, I have a strong interest in the intersection of AI with the arts and other humanities disciplines.
