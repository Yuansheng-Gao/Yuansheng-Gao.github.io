Hi, it's great to see you ~ ðŸ‘‹

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Technology at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) under the Senior Engineer [Zonghui Wang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/zhwang) and Professor [Wenzhi Chen](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0092215) since 2024 ðŸ¤—.

**Current Research**: My research focuses on `Large Language Models` ðŸ¤–. I am specifically exploring content safety and hallucination ðŸ˜Š.

**Undergraduate Research**: During my undergraduate years, I had the privilege of engaging in mathematical modeling and was awarded second prizeðŸ¥ˆ in the [China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling](https://en.mcm.edu.cn/) in my sophomore year ðŸŽ‰. It was during this time that I discovered my interest in `Metaheuristics` âœ¨.

**Feel free to contact me if you are curious about my research or to discuss potential collaborations, including but not limited to Large Language Models and Metaheuristics!** ðŸ˜„ You can contact me via Email(y.gao@zju.edu.cn) or WeChat (fyvknh).
