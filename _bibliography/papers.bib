  title={PID-based search algorithm: a novel metaheuristic algorithm based on PID algorithm},
  author={Gao, Yuansheng†},
  abstract={In this paper, a metaheuristic algorithm called PID-based search algorithm (PSA) is proposed for global optimization. The algorithm is based on an incremental PID algorithm that converges the entire population to an optimal state by continuously adjusting the system deviations. PSA is mathematically modeled and implemented to achieve optimization in a wide range of search spaces. PSA is used to solve CEC2017 benchmark test functions and six constrained problems. The optimization performance of PSA is verified by comparing it with seven metaheuristics proposed in recent years. The Kruskal-Wallis, Holm and Friedman tests verified the superiority of PSA in terms of statistical significance. The results show that PSA can be better balanced exploration and exploitation with strong optimization capability. Source codes of PSA are publicly available at https://ww2.mathworks.cn/matlabcentral/fileexchange/131534-pid-based-search-algorithm.},

  title={Love evolution algorithm: A stimulus--value--role theory-inspired evolutionary algorithm for global optimization},
  author={Gao, Yuansheng† and Zhang, Jiahui and Wang, Yulin and Wang, Jinpeng* and Qin, Lang*},
  abstract={This paper proposes the Love Evolution Algorithm (LEA), a novel evolutionary algorithm inspired by the stimulus–value–role theory. The optimization process of the LEA includes three phases: stimulus, value, and role. Both partners evolve through these phases and benefit from them regardless of the outcome of the relationship. This inspiration is abstracted into mathematical models for global optimization. The efficiency of the LEA is validated through numerical experiments with CEC2017 benchmark functions, outperforming seven metaheuristic algorithms as evidenced by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Friedman test. Further tests using the CEC2022 benchmark functions confirm the competitiveness of the LEA compared to seven state-of-the-art metaheuristics. Lastly, the study extends to real-world problems, demonstrating the performance of the LEA across eight diverse engineering problems. Source codes of the LEA are publicly available at https://ww2.mathworks.cn/matlabcentral/fileexchange/159101-love-evolution-algorithm.},

  title={An improved deep extreme learning machine to predict the remaining useful life of lithium-ion battery},
  author={Gao, Yuansheng† and Li, Changlin and Huang, Lei},
  abstract={To aim at the problem of inaccurate prediction of the remaining useful life of the lithium-ion battery, an improved grey wolf optimizer optimizes the deep extreme learning machine (CGWO-DELM) data-driven forecasting method is proposed. This method uses the grey wolf optimization algorithm based on an adaptive normal cloud model to optimize the bias of the deep extreme learning machine, the weight of the input layer, the selection of activation function, and the number of hidden layer nodes. In this article, indirect health factors that can characterize the degradation of battery performance are extracted from the discharge process, and the correlation between them and capacity is analyzed using the Pearson coefficient and Kendel coefficient. Then, the CGWO-DELM prediction model is constructed to predict the capacitance of the lithium-ion battery. The remaining useful life of lithium-ion batteries is indirectly predicted with a 1.44 A·h failure threshold. The prediction results are compared with deep extreme learning machines, long-term memory, other prediction methods, and the current public prediction methods. The results show that the CGWO-DELM prediction method can more accurately predict the remaining useful life of lithium-ion batteries.},
