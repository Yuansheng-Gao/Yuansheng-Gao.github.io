Prior to that, I received my B.Sc. degree in Information and Computing Science from <a href="https://en.lntu.edu.cn/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Liaoning Technical University</a>.</p> <p><strong>Current Research</strong>: My research focuses on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">generative AI</code>, particularly (multimodal) large language models ðŸ¤–. I am specifically exploring content safety, knowledge-based Q&amp;A, prompt learning, and fine-tuningâœ¨. Additionally, I have a keen interest in the intersection of AI with the arts and other humanities disciplines ðŸ˜Š.</p> <p><strong>Undergraduate Research</strong>: During my undergraduate years, I had the privilege of engaging in mathematical modeling and was awarded second prizeðŸ¥ˆ in the <a href="https://en.mcm.edu.cn/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling</a> in my sophomore year ðŸŽ‰. It was during this time that I discovered my interest in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">evolutionary computation</code> âœ¨. Alongside my undergraduate team, I contributed to the development of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S095741742301388X" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PID-based search algorithm (PSA)</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-024-05905-4" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">love evolution algorithm (LEA)</a>, and more ðŸš€. While Iâ€™m currently focused on generative AI, Iâ€™m still interested in evolutionary computation ðŸ”§.</p> <p><strong>Feel free to contact me if you are curious about my research or to discuss potential collaborations, including but not limited to generative AI and evolutionary computation!</strong> ðŸ˜„ You can contact me via Email(y.gao@zju.edu.cn) or WeChat (fyvknh).</p> </body></html>
